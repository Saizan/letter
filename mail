Hi Agneta,

I am sending this mail because I would like to defend my thesis on the
5th of Semptember. The following contains the requested information.

Name of student and link to homepage:
  Andrea Vezzosi http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~vezzosi/
Title of the PhD thesis:
  On Induction, Coinduction and Equality in Martin-Löf and Homotopy Type Theory
Supervisor    : Andreas Abel
Co-supervisor : Nils Anders Danielsson
Examiner      : Thierry Coquand
Suggested date and time: Wed, 5 Sep 2018, 10am - 12am
Venue for the defense: asked for a room to be booked at the EDIT building.

Opponent
  Rasmus Ejlers Møgelberg http://www.itu.dk/people/mogel/
  Title/position:
    associate professor at the IT University of Copenhagen.

  He has conducted research on guarded recursive types and models of
  type theory and homotopy type theory in particular.

  No papers co-authored with supervisor, examiner or student.

  He has been in the committee of the PhD defense of Guilhem Moulin in
  2016 but not as opponent.

We already confirmed that opponent and committee are available at the
defense date 2018/09/05, so we feel quite confident that we will not
need other options.
